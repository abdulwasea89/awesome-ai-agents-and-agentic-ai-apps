# üöÄ Google ADK Crash Course

A comprehensive tutorial series for learning Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) from basics to advanced concepts. This crash course is designed to take you from zero to hero in building AI agents with Google ADK.

## üìö What is Google ADK?

Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) is a flexible and modular framework for **developing and deploying AI agents**. It's optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem but is **model-agnostic** and **deployment-agnostic**, making it compatible with other frameworks.

### Key Features:
- **Flexible Orchestration**: Define workflows using workflow agents or LLM-driven dynamic routing
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Build modular applications with multiple specialized agents
- **Rich Tool Ecosystem**: Use pre-built tools, create custom functions, or integrate 3rd-party libraries
- **Deployment Ready**: Containerize and deploy agents anywhere
- **Built-in Evaluation**: Assess agent performance systematically
- **Safety and Security**: Built-in patterns for trustworthy agents

## üéØ Learning Path

This crash course covers the essential concepts of Google ADK through hands-on tutorials:

### üìö **Tutorials**

1. **[1_starter_agent](./1_starter_agent/README.md)** - Your first ADK agent
   - Basic agent creation
   - Understanding the ADK workflow
   - Simple text processing

2. **[2_model_agnostic_agent](./2_model_agnostic_agent/README.md)** - Model-agnostic agent development
   - Google Gemini models (AI Studio & Vertex AI)
   - Anthropic Claude integration
   - Local models with Ollama
   - LiteLLM integration for multiple providers

3. **[3_structured_output_agent](./3_structured_output_agent/README.md)** - Type-safe responses
   - Pydantic schemas
   - Structured data validation
   - Business logic implementation

4. **[4_tool_using_agent](./4_tool_using_agent/README.md)** - Agent with tools
   - Built-in tools (Search, Code Execution)
   - Function tools (Custom Python functions)
   - Third-party tools (LangChain, CrewAI)
   - MCP tools integration

5. **More tutorials coming soon!**

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before starting this crash course, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.8+** installed
